### Description

Our project will be a defusing bomb game which times the player to solve the puzzle in order to defuse the bomb before the timer runs out. The player has to solve a series of puzzles which are all required to be solved in order to get the password which defuses the bomb. Once the bomb has been defused the player(s) will be rewarded with a prize. 

**Game Rule:** Five minutes are given to defuse the bomb. Cut the correct wire to defuse bomb.

**Puzzles:**

Puzzle 1: Match the LED cycle to the mapped buttons

Puzzle 2: Answer the questions that appear on the LCD using the potentiometers

Puzzle 3: Decode the hint and remove the correct wire from the circuit to defuse the bomb

### Original work

Our inspiration for this project is mostly from the fact that we love solving puzzles and riddles. A game that we love is **Defusal** in Roblox where you try to defuse the bomb under time limit. A game like this would be more interesting and fun if we bring the game to real life and more hands-on experience, like an escape room.
